## Frameworks

Organizes UI elements.

Allows sensible grouping of elements.

## Some high-level frameworks

- `fluidPage()` -- 
- `fixedPage()` -- just rows and columns
- `fullPage()` -- fills up the browser window
- `tagList()` -- just sequential
- `navbarPage()` -- use with `tabPanel()` and `navbarMenu()`
- `miniUI::miniUI()` -- for add-ins or mobile
- `runtime::shiny` in an Rmd file -- for reports

##  `fluidPage()`

An organization using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/) CSS/JavaScript/HTML system.

Define containers based on a 12-unit wide grid.

## Return to Project 1

We're now going to throw away the original UI for Project 1.

- Look at `Muggle.R`. What kind of thing is `First`, `Second`, and so on in terms of user interfaces. 
- Modify `app.R` file to source the UI defined in `UI-languages.R`.
- Notice that the highest level container in `UI-languages.R` is `tagList()`.
    - What do you expect to happen when--don't do it yet!-- you replace `tagList()` with `fluidPage()`? Talk to your neighbor about what you expect to put a stake in the ground.
    - Now do the replacement.
    - What changes in the display of the app? Is this what you expected? If not, speculate on what's wrong?

## Need to use the grid system!

Nothing much was different between `fluidPage()` and `tagList()` in the previous exercise:

1. Usual all-in-a-line layout.
2. Fonts are different. 

In order to get things laid out, we need to specify rows and columns for the 12-unit Bootstrap grid.

Use `fluidRow(...)` to  group elements in a row.

Use `column(width=..., ...)`  to group elements in a column of the indicated width.

## Your turn

Edit `UI-languages.R` to change the UI to this.

![](images/fluid-wide.png)

## The tree

```r
UI <- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(width  = 4, First, Second),
    column(width = 3, Third)
  ),
  fluidRow(Fourth, Fifth),
  title = "Fluid!"
)
```
Your turn: Draw this as a tree with `First`, `Second` as the leaves and UI layout statements as the nodes. Hint: The root is at `fluidPage()`.

What's up with `title = "Fluid!"`?


## fluidPage() is responsive

The layout depends on the width of the device.

Narrow window | Wide window
--------------|-------------
![](images/fluid-narrow.png) | ![](images/fluid-wide.png)

## Your turn: A new tree

Draw this interface as a tree. Remember, the nodes are UI layout functions (like `column()`) and the leaves are `First`, `Second` and so on.

![](images/fluid-3.png)

Modify `UI-languages.R` to implement this tree.

## Answer:

```r
UI <- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(width  = 4, First, Second, Third),
    column(width = 6,
      column(width=8, Fourth), 
      column(width=3, Fifth)
    )
  )
)
```

## Your turn: Another tree

![](images/fluid-4.png)
Implement this UI. You'll need to use both the `width` and `offset` arguments to `column()`.


## Answer:

```r
UI <- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(width  = 4, First, Second, Third),
    column(width = 6, offset = 1,
      column(width=8,Fourth), 
      column(width=3, offset=1, Fifth)
    )
  )
)
```

## Convenience UI layout functions

- `titlePanel()`
- `sidebarLayout()` with `sidebarPanel()` & `mainPanel()`
- `tabsetPanel()` and `tabPanel()`
- `splitLayout()`
- `flowLayout()`
- `verticalLayout()`
- `wellPanel()`

## Your turn: Make this

Use `fluidPage()`, `titlePanel()`, and `wellPanel()`

![](images/layout-exercise-A.png) 

## The tree

```r
UI <- 
  fluidPage(
    titlePanel("My App's Title"),
    fluidRow(
      column(width = 4, 
        wellPanel(
          First, 
          wellPanel(
            Second), 
          Third)),
      column(width = 8, 
        wellPanel(
          Fourth), 
        Fifth)
  )
)
```

## Your turn: Make this

Use `fluidPage()`, `sidebarLayout()`, `sidebarPanel()`, mainPanel()` and `wellPanel()`

![](images/layout-exercise-B.png)

```r
UI <- 
  fluidPage(
    sidebarLayout(
      titlePanel("My App's Title"),
      sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
          First, 
          wellPanel(Second)),
        mainPanel(
         fluidRow(
           column(Third, width=8), 
           column(Fourth, width=4)), 
         Fifth)
    )
  )
)
```

## High-level layouts

- `tagList()` -- just sequential
- `fluidPage()` -- Bootstrap grid
- `navbarPage()` -- use with `tabPanel()` and `navbarMenu()`
- `miniUI::miniUI()`

## navbarPage

![](images/layout-exercise-C.png)

```r
navbarPage(
  title = "A navbarPage App",
  tabPanel(title="Latin/Arabic", First, Fourth),
  navbarMenu(title="Others",
             tabPanel(title="Ukrainian", Fourth),
             tabPanel(title = "Hebrew", Second),
             tabPanel(title = "Chinese", Fifth)
             )
  )
```

## miniUI

![](images/layout-exercise-D.png)

## The tree

```r
miniUI::miniPage(
    miniTitleBar("A miniPage App"),
    
    miniContentPanel(Fourth),
    miniTabstripPanel(
      miniTabPanel(title = "Chinese", 
                   miniButtonBlock(
                     actionButton("reset", "Reset to defaults"),
                     actionButton("clear", "Clear all")
                   ),
                   Fifth),
      miniTabPanel(title = "Ukrainian", 
                   miniTabstripPanel(
                     miniTabPanel(title="First", First),
                     miniTabPanel(title="Second", Second)),
                   Third),
      miniTabPanel(title = "Others",
                   First,
                   Second,
                   Third)
    )
```

## Exercise n-1

With your neighbor, draw the UI tree on paper.

## Exercise n

The [*Economist*'s Big Mac index visualizer](https://www.economist.com/news/2020/01/15/the-big-mac-index) isn't written as a Shiny app  (I think!), but sketch out how you would write a Shiny app to mimic it.
